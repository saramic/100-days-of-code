## Update

Started a new JavaScript project using [ParcelJS][parcel] based on an older project. This meant I installed `parcel-bundler` which is at version `1.3.1` or some such and upon doing an `npm install` I got a whole heap of high secuirty alerts, still it worked. Looking at the docs online I found out that there is a new [version `2.7.0`][npmjs-parcel-version] and to install that I needed to `npm add --saveDev parcel`. That aside, I have an `index.html` and a `src/loading-bar.js` which loads and attaches some basic `onclick` functionality to a button on an HTML page.

### Adding an animated progress bar

I decided to use the first best search result for "loading bar in pure javascript" and it was a good starting point to create an `interval` which updated the `style.width` of an element until it reached `100`. After some tweaking I got rid of some variables, reading the value from the bar instead and created some elements on the fly to create the actual `progress-bar`.

Interestingly I had a `//@ts-check` typescript check at the top of my file. I beieve this makes Typescript type checking run in VSCode and a few red squiggly lines showed up. Not wanting to install Typescript and allthat jazz I looked up how to add annotations with JS comments and it was pretty simple.

An example below of a method signure that takes a `param` and returns a `HTMLDivElement` and another of a `querySelector` that will later have `.disable` called on the resultent element so it needs to be an `HTMLInputElement`. The `... | null` was interesting in that it made me deal with the chance that the result is a `null` and in this case I just don't make a progress bar

{% highlight javascript %}
//@ts-check

/**
 * @param {HTMLDivElement} progressBarContainer
 * @returns {HTMLDivElement}
 */
const setupProgressBar = (progressBarContainer) => {

...

/** @type {HTMLInputElement | null}  */
const startJobButton = document.querySelector("button[id=start-job]");
{% endhighlight %}

That said, as I am using **ParcelJS** it actually probably would just compile my file if it was a `.ts` file. I presume this as when I decided to add some `scss` this just worked (although I did not actually use any scss hmm?)

{% highlight html %}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.scss">
{% endhighlight %}

### Progress so far

In Day 002 I got a clunky progress-bar with sidekiq-status gem that is tied to a job. Now in day 003 I have a smooth animated Javascript progress-bar that just smoothly does it's own thing. Below the blue line is the polled/clunky reloading progress bar and the green one is the smooth Javascript one (any jitter may be due to the limited animated gif framerate to keep the gif to a reasonable size)

![smooth vs clunky progress bar](/100-days-of-code/assets/images/smooth-vs-clunky-progress-bar.gif)

At some stage the idea will be to make the Javascript bar poll sidekiq-status and result in a smooth bar.

## Next Up

I think tomorrow I will diverge onto something that has interested me for a while and that is using the gem [ClosureTree/clsure_tree](https://github.com/ClosureTree/closure_tree) to work with hierarchical tree data structures in ActiveRecord.

we wil see ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
