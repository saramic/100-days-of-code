## Update

Started a new JavaScript project using [ParcelJS][parcel] based on an older project. This meant I installed `parcel-bundler` which is at version `1.3.1` or some such and upon doing an `npm install` I got a whole heap of high secuirty alerts, still it worked. Looking at the docs on line I found out that there is a new [version `2.7.0`][npmjs-parcel-version] and to install that I needed to `npm add --saveDev parcel`. That aside, I have an `index.html` and a `src/loading-bar.js` which loads and attaches some basic `onclick` functionality to a button on an HTML page.

* Next step will be to create an animated loading bar

* The step after will be to poll day 002 project to get updates on where the loading bar should be up to

* I think ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
