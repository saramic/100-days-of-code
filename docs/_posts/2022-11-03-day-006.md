## Update

A mixed bag today. I wrapped up another day of last years [AdventOfCode 2021 day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2). In this cacase interpreting a set of `up`, `down`, `forward` commands to retain position at the end of the sequence.

On a side project I had to ignore some `ESLint` errors on a side project to allow for a broken state in an app to be in the right spot for a demonstration. I failed to do it in the `package.json` but most likely as there was an `.eslingrc.js` file instead which presumably means the `package.json` exception would be removed? [Commit eca47a98 on failure-driven TODO pairing Dojo](https://github.com/failure-driven/todo-pairing-dojo/commit/eca47a98c664e5e2e923e2ff2da286ba4a78448f#diff-e2954b558f2aa82baff0e30964490d12942e0e251c1aa56c3294de6ec67b7cf5) ignoring the `no-unused-vars` rule in this case

{% highlight javascript %}
// .eslintrc.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: ["react", "jest"],
  ...
  rules: {
    ...
    "no-unused-vars": "off"
{% endhighlight %}
