## Update

I feel like I'm starting to feel some pressure with the **"100 Days of"**. Mostly as the weekend came and I had a lot of BasketBall games to take the kids to. This meant I did not manage to get my #100DaysOfRunning in for yesterday, the busyness and the fact my knee was hurting more then usual. The interesting thing is I felt super guilty all day long thinking of if I will and when I will do it. I also forgot to tweet my day 7 until this morning.

I suppose this feels like 1 of the benefits of the **#100DaysOfX** approach. As in the book, [Napoleon Hill "Think and Grow Rich"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30186948-think-and-grow-rich), the daily tweet becomes a sort of daily manifestation. It is front and center of your day very quickly and you start making decissions intentionaly towards that goal. This is very good and with a heavy heart did I go to bed yesterday not having tweeted about some "daily coding practice" I had done nore doing the running for the day.

In the end I did not get a chance to code today either - more basketball, kids parties, scouts and dog walks and reading Famous Five to the kids.
